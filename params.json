The American Institute of Architects designated the Frederick C. Robie House as one of the 10 most significant structures of the 20th century. It was one of the last buildings to be designed in Wright's Oak Park Studio. Wright used all the technological advancements of the time for his client Frederick C. Robie, a businessman. With its bold horizontal lines, daring cantilevers, stretches of art-glass windows and open floor plan, the homeâ€™s influence on architectural modernism is undisputed.\r\n***","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
